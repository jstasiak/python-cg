What is python-cg?
------------------

*python-cg* is a Python wrapper for
`NVidia Cg Toolkit <https://developer.nvidia.com/cg-toolkit>`_ runtime. I've started it because I like Python, I like NVidia CG and I want to to do some computer game/3d graphicsprototyping and research. Also I still find C++ counterproductive as far as my needs are concerned and I don't want to waste my time doing boring stuff. Programming in Python is fun.

I know about some projects that were meant to bring CG to Python but as far as I know they're history now.

Project is hostead at GitHub: https://github.com/jstasiak/python-cg.

What's the state?
-----------------

The project is in very early development stage. Overview of what's supported right now:

* Cg contexts

  * creating
  * destroying

* CgFX effects

  * creating from file
  * creating directly from source code

* accessing effects` techniques and their passes
* accessing effect parameters with their names, semantics and parameter-specific metadata (rows, columns etc.)
* setting sampler parameters and most of numerical parameters

What doesn't work at the moment and there's no plan to implement it:

* everything that's left (well, until I decide I need some of it or someone else does that)

Requirements
------------

This project requires:

* NVidia Cg Toolkit ≥ 3.0
* Python interpreter (+ development files):
  
  * 2.x ≥ 2.6, or
  * 3.x ≥ 3.2

* C and C++ compiler

Python packages required to build and install *python-cg*:

* Cython ≥ 0.18
* numpy

To build documentation/run tests you also need:

* Mock ≥ 1.0
* Nose ≥ 1.2
* Sphinx ~ 1.2 (development version)


Documentation
-------------

Pregenerated documentation can be found at https://python-cg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

You can also build documentation all by yourself by calling::

   sphinx-build -b html docs docs/build/html

Generated HTML files are placed in ``docs/build/html/`` directory.


Building
--------

To build the project in place, run::

   python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Important information
---------------------

* This project works with OpenGL and OpenGL only
* It uses row-major matrices by default, just like numpy does

Quickstart
----------

First you need to create an instance of
`CG <http://stasiak.at/python-cg/cg.html#cg.__init__.CG>`_ class and use it to create new
`Context <http://stasiak.at/python-cg/cg.html#cg.context.Context>`_::

   from cg import CG

   cg = CG()
   context = cg.create_context()

We want to use an effect to render some stuff so we're gonna create
`Effect <http://stasiak.at/python-cg/cg.effect.html#cg.effect.Effect>`_ from file::

   effect = context.create_effect_from_file('effect.cgfx')

.. note:: This assumes that you have a file named ``effect.cgfx`` and that it contains
   a valid CG effect.

We now have access to Effect's techniques and parameters::

   for technique in effect.techniques:
      # ...

   for parameter in effect.parameters:
      # ...


For the sake of simplicity let's say we have a parameterless effect with only one
`Technique <http://stasiak.at/python-cg/cg.effect.html#cg.effect.technique.Technique>`_::

   technique = effect.techniques[0]

Now we can access technique's passes. Each `Pass
<http://stasiak.at/python-cg/cg.effect.html#cg.effect.pass_.Pass>`_ has methods `begin()
<http://stasiak.at/python-cg/cg.effect.html#cg.effect.pass_.Pass.begin>`_ and `end()
<http://stasiak.at/python-cg/cg.effect.html#cg.effect.pass_.Pass.end>`_ and the actual
drawing has to take place between a call to ``begin`` and ``end``::

   gl.glClear(gl.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)

   for pass_  in technique.passes:
      pass_.begin()


      gl.glBegin(gl.GL_TRIANGLES)
      gl.glVertex3f(-0.5, -0.5, 0)
      gl.glVertex3f(0.5, -0.5, 0)
      gl.glVertex3f(0, 0.5, 0)
      gl.glEnd()

      pass_.end()

   # swap buffers

You can find complete, runnable example application in ``example`` directory. Please note that
it requires (in addition to *python-cg* requirements):

* Development version of SFML 2
* Python packages listed in ``example/requirements.txt``::

   pip install -r example/requirements.txt

Then to run the example::

   python setup.py build_ext --inplace
   PYTHONPATH=. python example/main.py


Testing
-------

To run tests, execute::

   python runtests.py
